# Flight-route-planner
This C-based flight route planner reads flight data, stores cities and routes, and uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path within a budget. It also uses DFS to explore all feasible paths and BFS to find reachable cities within a distance, providing comprehensive route planning.
